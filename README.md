ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Basil (he/him)

I'm a software engineer currently working primarily on personal projects in Rust. I've been learning GPU programming recently, but also have had a great time working with game engines, blockchain, native macOS, the web, machine learning, music/audio processing and more using a variety of languages.

Recently I've:

- Completed a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com)
- Worked on various [games](https://github.com/thebasilisk/mirror-maze)
- Started building a [text editor](https://github.com/thebasilisk/txt-rs)

Future project ideas:

- Classic Nintendo console emulator in Rust
- Full 3D renderer for various games
- Generative shader art projects
- Rust Crate for simple macOS app developement
